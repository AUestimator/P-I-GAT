# P-I-GAT

(The source code, appendix descriptions and processed dataset are gradually organizing and uploading)


The P-I-GAT model is used for achieving the graded diagnoisis of depression.


Hardware: 4.7GHz Intel Core i7 Processor 
          16GB LPDDR5 RAM


Environment: Python (-Version 3.9.7)
             PyTorch framework (-Version1.12.1)

key steps: preprocess the raw data → transform the data type → train the P-I-GAT model → classify EEG from depression patients with different grades
